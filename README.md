#Cobb Tuning Website Layout

This is a midterm project for Fall 2015 ACA Front End Intro. The purpose of the project is to exhibit everything I have learned in HTML and CSS thus far. The layout is a predetermined frame provided by the instructor. The content is based on a company/organization of our choosing.
