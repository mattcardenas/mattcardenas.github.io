                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>With over 15 years of Research and Development, COBB Tuning has created Upgrade Paths designed to provide you with everything you will need to go from a bone stock car to a powerful, drivable, daily smile-making machine.</p>

                <h3>The Starting Line</h3>
                <p>Each path is specifically designed to maximize power of the Accessport, Hard Parts and our Off-The-Shelf maps. With these results, COBB is able to create the Upgrade Path of Staged Packages that have all the necessary parts to upgrade your car</p>

                <h3>Accessport</h3>
                <p>The COBB Tuning Accessport is the first and easiest modification you can make to your car to see instant results.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="package">
                <img src="img/cobbway_steps_02.jpg" alt="Step02" />

                <h3>Stage Power Packages</h3>
                <p>Our engineers rigorously test Hard Parts to find the right order and combination for the best incremental power gains. Maps are created and tested to tune the ECU so that it supports and takes advantage of each part.</p>

                <h3>Custom Tuning</h3>
                <p>So what is custom tuning? Custom tuning means fine tuning an existing COBB Off the Shelf Map or creating a new map from scratch, to gain the maximum performance for your set up. </p>
